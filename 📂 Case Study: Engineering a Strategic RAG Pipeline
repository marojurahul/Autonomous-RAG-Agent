The Technical "Why" Behind the Build
1. Why Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?
I chose a RAG-based architecture instead of a simple LLM prompt to ensure the AI remains grounded in the specific contract uploaded. 
By retrieving context from a Vector Store, I prevented "hallucinations" and ensured the Key Risks identified were based solely on the provided 
document rather than general training data.

2. Why n8n for Orchestration?
I utilized n8n as the central orchestrator to manage the multi-step lifecycle of document intelligence. 
It allowed me to bridge the gap between user chat inputs, Google Drive file management, and vectorized 
memory in a single, scalable, and visually verifiable workflow.

3. Overcoming Structural Constraints
Legal and enterprise documents have complex, hierarchical structures that simple AI models often break down. 
I implemented a Recursive Character Text Splitter within the workflow to chunk data intelligently. 
This ensures the AI analyzes paragraphs and clauses in their full context, preserving the legal integrity of the analysis.
